		<div>JFK’s Space Race Goal</div>
		<div>July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and entered lunar orbit. They orbited the Moon 30 times before they would start the descent and attempt the landing.
</div>
		<div>Apollo 11 entered near-circular Earth orbit about 12 minutes into the flight. They orbited Earth one and a half times before the third-stage engines engaged again and the Columbia separated from the used engines, sending the Columbia and Eagle towards the Moon and the used engines into orbit around the Sun.
</div>
		<div>2 minutes and 42 seconds into
the flight, the first-stage engines shutdown and the second-stage engines engaged and ignited. The second-stage engines cut off and separated at about 9 minutes and 8 seconds, allowing the third-stage engines to engage.
</div>
		<div>Site Decision</div>
		<div>The Saturn V launched Apollo 11 on July 16, 1969 at 9:32:00 AM EDT from the Kennedy Space Center.
</div>
		<div>The Craft
</div>
		<div>July 20, 1969 at 12:52:00 UTC, Aldrin and Armstrong started the preparations for the descent to the surface of the Moon, separating from the Columbia at 17:44:00.</div>

</div>
		<div>The Surface & Return
</div>
		<div>False. The original landing site was overshot by several miles because the craft picked up speed coming out of lunar orbit & moved too quickly. There is also a possibility that the Eagle picked up speed when it detached from the Columbia.
</div>
		<div>The Landing
</div>
		<div>False. The Eagle’s landing procedure took longer than it had in training, leaving the ship with 50 seconds of usable fuel at the point of landing, though Mission Control thought at the time they had less than 30 seconds.
</div>
		<div>Unexpected variables had a number of effects on the 1969 moon landing.
What do you think happened?
</div>
		<div>The ship’s computer displayed two non-dangerous warnings before landing.
</div>
		<div>True. A 1201 and a 1202 alarm occurred to both communicate the computer needs time to cool down from the number of requests or postpone
the lower priority tasks. Mission control took some of the computer tasks to fix the problem.
</div>
		<div>The craft landed short of the intended landing site because the speed of approach was too slow.
</div>
		<div>“Houston, Tranquility Base
      here. The Eagle has landed.”
“Roger, Tranquility. We copy
      you on the ground."
</div>
		<div>The Eagle had well over a minute of fuel remaining when the landing was complete.</div>

		<div>The crew had to wake up over five hours before the launch for the pre-flight process.</div>
		<div>At July 16th, 1969, at 9:32 AM EDT, the Apollo 11 launch achieved liftoff. Aside from those attending the launch in person, it was televised in 33 countries and broadcast to millions more over radio.
