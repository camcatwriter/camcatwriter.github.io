                <p>Amphibians may be the last thing people think of when they visit
                    Canyonlands. However, the park is home to a variety of frogs 
                    and toads, as well as one species of salamander. Witnessing a 
                    chorus of toads may be one of the most memorable experiences 
                    canyon country has to offer. It is an awesome event that can 
                    fill a canyon with sound, sometimes for hours. Amphibians are 
                    animals that have two life stages: a larval, aquatic form and an
                    adult, terrestrial form. This is the difference between a tadpole
                    and a frog.</p> <p>In Canyonlands, amphibians lay their eggs in the 
                    potholes, springs and intermittent streams found throughout the 
                    park. Swift currents and predation limit survival during the 
                    larval stage in bigger rivers like the Colorado. In Canyonlands,
                     amphibian populations are greatest along small perennial streams
                      like those in Horseshoe Canyon near the Maze, and Salt Creek 
                      Canyon in the Needles District. To protect park resources, 
                      vehicle use in Horseshoe Canyon was prohibited in the 1970s, 
                      and vehicle use in Salt Creek Canyon was prohibited in June 1998.</p>
