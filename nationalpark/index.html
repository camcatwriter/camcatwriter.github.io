                <p>Amphibians may be the last thing people think of when they visit
                    Canyonlands. However, the park is home to a variety of frogs 
                    and toads, as well as one species of salamander. Because of this 
                    sensitivity, amphibians have become “indicator species,” the health 
                    of which can be used to measure the health of an ecosystem. In Canyonlands, 
                    amphibian populations are greatest along small perennial 
                    streams like those in Horseshoe Canyon and Salt Creek Canyon.</p>

                <p>Birds are the most visible animals in Canyonlands. Even on the 
                    hottest summer day, turkey vultures and white-throated swifts 
                    circle above the canyons. During winter, juncos and white-crowned 
                    sparrows forage around trees and shrubs. While Canyonlands may not 
                    be considered a bird watching hot spot, 273 species have been seen 
                    in the park. Canyonlands monitors bird populations at several selected 
                    locations in both upland and riparian areas.</p>

                <p>Almost 50 species of mammal are known to live in Canyonlands. Some 
                    animals, like desert cottontails, kangaroo rats and mule deer, are 
                    common and may be seen by a majority of visitors. Tracks and scat are the                     
                    most common signs of an animal’s presence. Larger mammals, like mule deer 
                    and mountain lions, must cover more territory in order to find food and water,                     
                    and sometimes migrate to nearby mountains during summer.</p>
