                <p>Amphibians may be the last thing people think of when they visit
                    Canyonlands. However, the park is home to a variety of frogs 
                    and toads, as well as one species of salamander. Because of this 
                    sensitivity, amphibians have become “indicator species,” the health 
                    of which can be used to measure the health of an ecosystem. Thus far, 
                    neither mutations nor population declines have been observed at 
                    Canyonlands, but their importance as an indicator species has made 
                    preserving amphibian habitat a priority for the National Park Service. 
                    In Canyonlands, amphibian populations are greatest along small perennial 
                    streams like those in Horseshoe Canyon near the Maze, and Salt Creek 
                      Canyon in the Needles District. To protect park resources, 
                      vehicle use in Horseshoe Canyon was prohibited in the 1970s, 
                      and vehicle use in Salt Creek Canyon was prohibited in June 1998.</p>

                <p>Birds are the most visible animals in Canyonlands. Even on the 
                    hottest summer day, turkey vultures and white-throated swifts 
                    circle above the canyons. During winter, juncos and white-crowned 
                    sparrows forage around trees and shrubs. While Canyonlands may not 
                    be considered a bird watching hot spot, 273 species have been seen 
                    in the park, including seasonal and year-round residents as well as 
                    migrants. Canyonlands monitors bird populations at several selected 
                    locations in both upland and riparian areas. Findings from these 
                    surveys and others like them are used to monitor the health of local 
                    bird populations and estimate species richness throughout the country.</p>

                <p>
                    Almost 50 species of mammal are known to live in Canyonlands. Some 
                    animals, like desert cottontails, kangaroo rats and mule deer, are 
                    common and may be seen by a majority of visitors. However, many desert 
                    animals are inactive during daylight hours or wary of humans, so 
                    sightings can be truly special events. Tracks and scat are the most common 
                    signs of an animal’s presence. Larger mammals, like mule deer and mountain 
                    lions, must cover more territory in order to find food and water, and 
                    sometimes migrate to nearby mountains during summer. In Utah, around 80 
                    percent of a mountain lion’s diet consists of mule deer, so these animals 
                    are never far apart. However, unlike mule deer, mountain lion sightings 
                    are very rare. </p>
